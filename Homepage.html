            <p>The Harmandir Sahib literally means the Temple of God. Guru Amar Das had ordered Guru Ram Das to create a
                nectarous tank as a place for worship for the Sikh religion. Guru Ram Das instructed all his Sikhs to
                join in the work, under Bhai Budha's superintendence, and engaged labourers to assist them. He said that
                the tank of nectar should be God's home, and whoever bathed in it shall obtain all spiritual and
                temporal advantages. During the progress of the work, the hut in which the Guru first sheltered himself
                was expanded for his residence; it is now known as the Guru's Mahal, or palace.[12]</p>

            <p>In 1578 Guru Ram Das excavated a tank, which subsequently became known as Amritsar (Pool of the Nectar of
                Immortality),[13] giving its name to the city that grew around it. In due course, the Harmandir
                Sahib,[14] was built in the middle of this tank and became the supreme centre of Sikhism. Its sanctum
                came to house the Adi Granth comprising compositions of Sikh Gurus and other saints considered to have
                Sikh values and philosophies, e.g., Baba Farid, and Kabir. The compilation of the Adi Granth was started
                by the fifth guru of Sikhism, Guru Arjan.</p>
